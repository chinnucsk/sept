Stupid erlang project tools

These are transitory scripts while I try to find something to handle my erlang
hobby projects without using cumbersome building frameworks. You probably don't
want to use this, but just in case:

  * get_dirty.sh: peeks all the git repositories to make sure that all are
    committed (locally)
  * make.sh: enter in all src files and run erlang -make like script to build
    the binaries
  * run.sh: fire a VM with the code path set to load from what we built
  * update.sh: pull in all git repositories
