These are transitory scripts while I try to find something to handle my erlang
hobby projects without using cumbersome building frameworks. You probably don't
want to use this, but just in case:

You're supposed to download this repository in a lib directory, where any other
repositories containing erlang applications lie around. Once done, you have to
cd into sept and run ./install.sh.

  * get_dirty.sh: peeks all the git repositories to make sure that all are
    committed (locally)
  * get_ahead.sh: prints the list of git repositories that have changes that are
    not in upstream
  * get_svn_ahead.sh: prints the list of git repositories that have changes that
    are not in the svn upstream
  * get_branch: prints the branch in which repository is
  * install.sh: links all scripts in .. so that you can run them for the whole
    project
  * make.sh: enter in all src files and run erlang -make like script to build
    the binaries. You can also pass a directory as first argument and will make
    only that director (much faster)
  * run.sh: fire a VM with the code path set to load from what we built
  * update.sh: pull in all git repositories
  * tarball.sh: create a distributable tarball for a single application, adding
    the git version to the name
